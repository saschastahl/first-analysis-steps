<p>Imagine you want to design and run a new particle detector. Apart from organizing a collaboration, creating the design and specification, and several other tasks, you will also have to find solutions to many computational challenges. It's worth thinking about these for a second:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we collect data as it is recorded by the detector?</li>
<li>How do we filter and process the recorded data efficiently?</li>
<li>How do we manage all the complex tasks required to work with collision data?</li>
<li>How do we organize all the data of a single bunch crossing in a flexible way?</li>
<li>How do we configure our software flexibly without having to recompile it?</li>
<li>Can you think of more?</li>
</ul>
<p>How would you go about solving these? The decisions you make will affect the performance of your experiment during datataking and analysis.</p>
<p>At LHCb, we base our software on the <a href="https://proj-gaudi.web.cern.ch/proj-gaudi/">Gaudi</a> framework, which was specifically designed with the above questions in mind. It's worth getting an idea of some of the most important Gaudi concepts at this point. After this, we will jump right into running the software and getting useful things done.</p>
<p><strong>Event Loop</strong> Because the individual bunch crossings (events) are almost completely independent of each other, it makes sense to process them one by one, without holding them all in memory at once. Gaudi provides a global EventLoop, which allows you to process events one by one.</p>
<p><strong>Transient Event Store</strong> A single event contains lots of different data objects (Particles, Vertices, Tracks, Hits, ...). In Gaudi, these are organized in the Transient Event Store (TES). You can think of it as a per-event file system with locations like <code>/Event/Rec/Track/Best</code> or <code>/Event/Phys/MyParticles</code>. When running over the event stream, Gaudi allows you to get and put from/to these locations. The contents of the TES are emptied at the end of the processing of each event.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithms</strong> An <em>Algorithm</em> is a C++ class that can be inserted into the EventLoop. These allow you to perform a certain function for each event (like filtering according to trigger decision, reconstructing particles, ...).</p>
<p><strong>Tools</strong> Often, algorithms will want to make use of some common function (vertex fitting, calculating distances, associating a primary vertex, ...). These are implemented as <em>Tools</em>, which are shared between Algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>Options</strong> To make all of this configurable, Gaudi allows you to set properties of <em>Algorithms</em> and <em>Tools</em> from a Python script, called an <em>option</em> file. In an option file, you can specify which Algorithms are run in which order, and set their properties (strings, integers, doubles, and lists and dicts of these things can be set). You can then start the Gaudi EventLoop using this option file, and it will set up and run the corresponding C++ objects with specified settings.</p>
<p>You can find comprehensive documentation in the <a href="https://proj-gaudi.web.cern.ch/proj-gaudi/releases/latest/doxygen/">Gaudi Doxygen</a> or the <a href="http://lhcb-comp.web.cern.ch/lhcb-comp/Frameworks/Gaudi/Gaudi_v9/GUG/GUG.pdf">Gaudi Manual</a>.</p>
<p>Usually, you will work with one of the LHCb software projects that are based on Gaudi. One of the most important ones is <em>DaVinci</em>, which provides lots of <em>Algorithms</em> and <em>Tools</em> for physics analysis.</p>
<p>You can run DaVinci using the following command:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">lb-run</span> DaVinci v36r6 gaudirun.py</code></pre>
<p>This will run the <code>gaudirun.py</code> command using version v36r6 of DaVinci. <code>gaudirun.py</code> is a script that sets up the EventLoop. You should get the following output:</p>
<pre><code># setting LC_ALL to &quot;C&quot;

<p>During this run, DaVinci didn't do anything: We didn't specify any algorithms to run or any data to run over. Usually, you will write an option file (e.g. <code>options.py</code>) and specify it as an argument to <code>gaudirun.py</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">lb-run</span> DaVinci v36r6 gaudirun.py options.py</code></pre>
<p>An <code>option.py</code> is just a regular Python script that specifies how to set things up in the software. Many of the following lessons will teach you how to do something with DaVinci by showing you how to write or extend an <code>options.py</code>. You can use the above command to test it. You can also specify several option files like this:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">lb-run</span> DaVinci v36r6 gaudirun.py options1.py options2.py</code></pre>
<p>They will then both be used to set up DaVinci.</p>
<p>Do you want to get an overview of which versions of DaVinci exist? Use</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">lb-run</span> --list DaVinci</code></pre>
<p>Do you want to start a shell that already contains the LHCb environment, so you don't have to use <code>lb-run</code>? Execute</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">lb-run</span> DaVinci v36r6 <span class="ot">$SHELL</span></code></pre>
<p>A simple <code>gaudirun.py</code> should work as well now. Typing <code>exit</code> will close the shell and leave the LHCb environment behind.</p>

<h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>Using SetupProject instead of lb-run</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>When reading through other tutorials, you will come across <code>SetupProject</code>. This is an older way of setting up a shell that is configured to run LHCb software. <code>lb-run</code> is the new way of doing things and has some nice benefits over <code>SetupProject</code>. For most purposes, <code>SetupProject DaVinci v36r6</code> is equivalent to</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">lb-run</span> DaVinci v36r6 <span class="ot">$SHELL</span></code></pre>
